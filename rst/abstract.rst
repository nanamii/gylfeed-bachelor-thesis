    Abstract
    ========

This paper shows a way to build a music recommendation system based on
datamining algorithms and a nearest neighbor graph. A extensible python library
is developed, using a variety of inputs differing from music metadata like
lyrics or the genre to the analysis of the associated audio data. In order to
demonstrate and verify the results, a Gtk-based MPD client is developed that can
be used either as debugging tool or true media player. Various techniques are
shown to compare all possible attributes of a song with each other in an
efficient way.
