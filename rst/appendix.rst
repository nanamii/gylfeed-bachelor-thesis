    Song

        In libmunin's Context a Song is a set of attributes that have a name and
        a value. For example a Song might have an ``artist`` attribute with the
        value **Amon Amarth**.

        Apart from the Attributes, every Song has a unique ID.

    Distance

        A distance is the similarity of two songs or attributes **a** and **b**
        expressed in a number between 0.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 means maximal
        unsimilarity. Imagining a point space, two points are identical when
        their geometric distance is 0.0.
        
        The Distance is calculated by the :term:`DistanceFunction`.

    DistanceFunction

        A **DF** is a function that takes two songs and calculates the
        :term:`Distance` between them. 

        More specifically, the **DF** looks at all Common Attributes of two
        songs **a** and **b** and calls a special **DF** attribute-wise.
        These results are weighted, so that e.g. ``genre`` gets a higher
        precedence, and summed up to one number.

        The following must be true for a valid **DF**, when :math:`D` is the
        database:
   
            :math:`D(i, j) = D(j, i) \forall i,j \in D`

            :math:`D(i, i) = 0.0 \forall i \in D`

            :math:`D(i, j) \leq D(i, x) + (x, j)`

    Session

        A Session is the usage of *libmunin* over the time on one music
        collection. It can be saved to disk and later resumed.

    Mask

        Every :term:`Session` requires a Mapping where the possible keys are
        defined that a single song may have. The **AM** stores this information
        as dictionary, the keys being the names of the possible attributes and
        the values being a tuple, conisting of the :term:`Provider` for this
        :term:`Attribute`, a fitting Distance Function and a weight.

    Attribute

        An *Attribute* is a key in the :term:`Mask` to which a :term:`Provider`,
        a :term:`DistanceFunction` and a certain weight is attached. The name of
        the *Attribute* will be used in :term:`Song` s to reference the
        individual values.

    Provider 

        Normalizes a Value by certain characteristics. The resulting value
        should be optimized for comparasion by areturn :term:`DistanceFunction`.

    Rule
        
        A *Rule* associates certain songs, or one single song with other songs
        or another single song. The strenght of the association is given by the
        *rating* of the rule, which is technically calculated as: 

            :math:`(1.0 - Kulczynski) \cdot Imbalance`

    Recommendation

        A *Recommendation* is a :term:`Song` that is outputted as a request by
        the user. The outputed :term:`Song` s should have a low :term:`Distance` 
        to the previously listened or to the seed song.

    Graph 

        The *Graph* models the relation between all :term:`Song` in the
        database. Each song has, in the best case, the most similar :term:`Song` s
        to it as neighbors. Since this would require calculating the
        :term:`Distance` from one song to all others, which in turn requires
        quadratic complexity. Therefore an approximation of the *Graph* is built 
        that might contain small errors.
